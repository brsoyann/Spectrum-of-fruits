# Spectrum-of-fruits

## Who are we

This project was created for the preparatory works of ["Physics and We"](https://www.facebook.com/Physics.and.We) camp. This camp is organized by the student chapter of [SPIE](https://spie.org/#_=_) and [OPTICA](https://www.optica.org/) scientific communties in Yerevan State University, [YSO](https://www.facebook.com/ysostudentchapter). "Physics and We"'s main goal is to propagate physics, programming and engineering into youth, especially high schoolers and university students. During one week of the camp, applicants will be divided into four groups, each of them will have their own project. The project, for which this repository was created, aims in the research of spectrum of different materials, in this case of different fruits.

## What is spectrum of fruits

All substances with temperatures higher than 0 Kelvin emit some electromagnetic radiation. When an electron changes its energy level, it emits or absorbs photons of some wavelength, depending on the difference in the energy levels. Each atom has a unique spectral line, just like people have their fingerprints. The dark and light lines (observed during absorption and reflection of light) depend on the internal structure of atoms. The reflection spectrum is due to the radiation source. An absorption spectrum is formed when light passing through an optical medium is partially absorbed. You can read more about spectroscopy on the sci-pop [article](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/kLUf5iqJt7AehrKP/) written by YSO memebers in official facebook page.

## The main goal

In this repository we are working in categorising different absorbtion spectras of fruits which were derived experimentally. Though, using machine learning tools, we want to automize the process of identifying fruits based on their spectra data.
